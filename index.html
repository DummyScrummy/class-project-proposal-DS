        <h2>Application Overview:</h2>
        <h3>From the end user perspective, eCAMS Billboard serves as an all-in-one</br>
            educational information hub for the eCAMS department here at Lewis. The</br>
            product contains information for professor names and office locations,</br>
            as well as displaying new and informative "flyer" pictures as a</br>
            slideshow that also runs while the site is idle.</h3>

        <h2>Technology Overview:</h2>
        <h3>The eCAMS Billboard is currently a web-based site that runs with a client side</br>
            fetching it's data from a database within an Express/Node.js server. It runs</br>
            on a touch screen display that is located in the center of the eCAMS</br>
            department near classroom AS-104A. The site is pushed by our team to</br>
            a GItHub Organization repository, hosted on Azure, and deployed for</br>
            display using a Raspberry Pi. There is also a test site for use</br>
            before publishing/deploying.</h3>
